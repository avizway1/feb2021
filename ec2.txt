EC2 : Elastic Compute Cloud : 

Instance = Server = Box = Azure VM = GCP Engine


Pay-as-you-go machanism..!!

ec2 : Elastic compute cloud :

On-Demand ec2 instances : Unpredictable workload.. Testing our application.. No stable workloads..
Price : /Sec (with Min of 60 Sec)

Reserved Instances / RI : Predictable workloads.. Stable workloads.. FOr long terms with AWS.. Duration: 1 Yr / 3 yr

	Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration.
	Convertable RI : We can upgrade the configuration.
	Scheduled RI : Persisant req during the purchased duration (ex: MON-FRI, weekly 	40 hrs)

Price : FullUpfront : Pay 100% now, get your instance.
	Partial Upfront : Pay 30-50% now, AWS will reduse the hourly price, Within month 	how many hours you are using, pay for that only.
	No Upfront : Need to hourly basis.

Spot Instances : We can bid against the aws pricing, IF your quoted price is equal or more than aws price, We will get the instance.
--> If Price increased by AWS, Our instances terminates. We no need to pay for Partial Hour.   1 hr 45 min : 1 hr cost
--> If price not increase by AWS, you terminated your instance, we need to pay full hour cost.   1 hr 45 min :  1 hr 45 min Cost


ec2 instance isolation diagram : 

Tenancy : 
Shared Tenancy : underlying hardware shared with multiple customers.
Dedicated Tenancy : Underlying hardware will not share with any other customers.
	--> Dedicated Instane : We wil get dedicated instance.
	--> Dedicated Host : We can launch multiple instances. If you want to bind any 		licenses to cpu/memory reosurces, we need to choose this.

Ec2 is a region specific service.

Mumbai : Very near to me..!! 
NVirginia : 


Step 1 : Choose an AMI (Amazon Machine Image)		: CHoose the OS

Step 2 : CHoose the Instance type			: Choose t2.micro (FREE TIER)

General Purpose : gives balance performance of compute, memory and networking resources. We use this for wide usecases. 
--> t2, t3, t3a, m4, m5, m5a, m6g, a1

COmpute Otimized : optimised for compute bound applications that requires hight perf processors. More CPU utilized resources.
--> c4, c5, c5n, c6g

Memory Optimized : TO process large data set via memory.  More Memory consumed application required this type of instances.
--> r4, r5, r5n, r6g, x1, x1e, z1

Accelerated Computing : More Grahic processing, if application required hardware acceleration..!! GPU instances.
--> p4, p3, p2, g3, g4, f1

Storage optimized : High perf from the storage (hard disk).  It gives more I/O per
(IOPS) from storage.
--> h1, d2, d3, d3en, i3


t3.xlarge, 4 vCPU, 16 RAM
c5.xlarge, 4 vCPU, 8 RAM
m4.large, 2 vCPU, 8 RAM

Step 3 : Choose additional options.

Shutdown behavior : Stop  (What should happen to your ec2 instance if you initiate shutdown from OS level)
Enable termination protection : Enable

Step 4: Add Storage				: windows 30 Gb

Step 5 : Add tags
	Name : 
	Application : App X
	COst center : AZZAA
	Platform    : Windows / Linux

Step 6 : COnfigure the Security groups (0-65535 protocols/port)

Windows : RDP : 3389 : 0.0.0.0/0
Linux : SSH : 22
webserver : http : 80
Secure webserver : https : 443
ms sql : 1433
mysql : 3306
DNS : 53

Step 7 : Review and Launch instance with a Keypair.

AWS Holds the public, aws copies that public key to the ec2 instance.
We will get the private key (.pem), If we want to connect to the instance, we need to browse the private key against the public key.. Then we will get the password. 


TO connect to windows instance:
--> run --> mstsc --> enter --> remote desktop connection windows
--> go to start and search for "remote desktop"
--> Select instance--> click on "connect" --> RDP Client --> "Download remote desktop file" --> open it.


Task : Launch an ec2 instance, connect to instance with the keypair given password.. and change the password.. Signout then try to login with keypair given password and custom password..!!!!

Task 2 : WIndows instances supports 2 terminal connections.. 
--> Create another user at OS level.. Provide Local Admin rights to this user.. Provide "Remote desktop permissions".. 
--> keep Administrator session active... and try to take session as newly created OS user.
