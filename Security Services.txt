Cloudtrail : Logging service with in AWS environment. Enabled by defaultly in all accounts. It stores last 90 days logs.

We can create a trail and store logs in s3 bucket for unlimited days. If required we can apply bucket life cycle to delete the logs after * days.

--> Management events : Capture management operations performed on your AWS resources.
--> Data events : Log the resource operations performed on or within a resource. (S3, dynamodb and Lambda).
--> Insights events : Identify unusual activity, errors, or user behavior in your account.

**Recommended to create a trail for every event type.
** For external audits, create a central bucket and store all the logs in central bucket and deliver it to external auditor.


We have "amazon Athena" to query the Cloudtrail logs.
We can use "DataDog", "Cloudchkr" and Splunk to analyse the ct logs.
