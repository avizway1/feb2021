S3 : Simple Storage Service : 

--> Object based Storage : We can store only flat files.
--> Block based storage : EBS / Instance Store : Designed run OS / Application / cluster.
--> Storage over the Network : NAS/SAN : EFS / FSx : Storage avaiblae over the network..


--> S3 is global resource (like IAM). Doesn't required any region selection.
--> WHile creating bucket, we need to choose the region. Data physically stores in that region.
--> Bucket : FOlder/Directory with unique namespace.
--> Bucket name should be unique across the globe. 
--> Bucket naming standards:
	--> Min char : 3 , Max char: 63 char
	--> No capital letters
	--> Should not start with special char
	--> SHould not start with . , should end with the . , No adjesent ..
	--> Should not resemble IP address format.
--> We have unlimited storage in s3 platform.
--> No Pre-Provisioning required. 
--> Max Object Size is 5 terabytes (TB) , Min Size 0 bytes.

Public Access Settings :
--> To make any object public, We need to "Turn Off" "Block Public ACcess" at bucket level.
--> Choose the object you want to make public, Then "Make Public".

Task 1 : Create an IAM user, associate "AdministratorAccess", Login and try to access billing information..!!! It will deny... Enable Billing access to IAM users..!!

Free Tier : 5 Gb S3 - Standard Storage..!!

If data is in glacier, we need to initiate restoration.
expedated : 1-5 Min
Standard  : 3-5 Hours
Bulk restore : >12 Hours

___

Versioning : 
--> When versioning is enabled, if we delete an object (Versioning: hide) We will get a delete marker.
--> Delete the DeleteMarket to get the object back to s3.
--> When versining set to "SHOW", if you delete any object it won't create any delete marker.

delete : Create a Delete marker.
permanently delete : It Delete permanently.

Life Cycle Management RUle : To trasit data from One storage class to another storage class. TO delete data automatically. 


Same Region Replication / Cross Region Replication (SRR/CRR): 
--> Existing data will not replicate. ALl the future/subsequent uploads will replicate to destination bucket.

RTC : When we enable this feature all the object will replicate with in 15 minutes.


Task : What is Replication Priority..? What does 0, 1 ..?

Task 2 : Configure Lifecycle management rule to trasit data from S3Standard to Delete after 2 days for Current version also for previous version of the object.

Same region repliucation won't cost. 
CRR will cost us : Data transfer..!!

Encryption on AWS : 
KMS Key Management Service.


In-Transit Encryption : 
--> SSL / TLS 

At-Rest Encryption / Server Side Encryption (SSE):
--> SSE - S3  : Encryption material will be generated and managed by S3 platform. Whoever have valid permissions on S3 platform they can decrypt the data.

--> SSE - KMS : 
	--> aws/s3 : DMK (Default Master key) (AWS managed keys) Encryption material will be generated and managed by KMS. Whoever have valid permissions on S3 platform they can decrypt the data.
	--> KMS/customname : CMK (Customer Managed Key) Encryption material will be generated and managed by KMS. Whoever have valid permissions on KMS KEY they can decrypt the data.  "NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY"

Symmetric : A single encryption key that is used for both encrypt and decrypt operations
Asymmetric : A public and private key pair that can be used for encrypt/decrypt or sign/verify operation.

--> Creating a KMS Key :
	--> Choose Symmetric / Asymetric
	--> Give an Alias
	--> Allocate KEY ADMINISTRATORS
	--> Allocate KEY USERS

--> SSE - C  : Customer Provided Key material :  Encryption material shoild be generated and uploaded to KMS, and KMS manages the Key usage with our own logic. Whoever have valid permissions on KMS KEY they can decrypt the data.  "NO FREE TIER ELIGIBILITY"



Client Side Encryption (CSE) : AWS won't take any responsibility. We are uploading encrypted data to aws s3 platform. Use your own infra application to encrypt the data then upload the data to s3.

___________

Server access logging : We can logging on an individual bucket with this feature.

Transfer acceleration : We can upload/download data via Edge location to s3 bucket. We can run speed compariosn tool before enabling this feature.

Event Notifications : 
--> SNS Simple Notification Service : Example

Object Lock : 
--> Versioning must be enabled.

Governance : Users with specific IAM permissions can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.

Compliance : No users can overwrite or delete protected object versions during the retention period.


Task : Bucket1 , IAm User IAMUser1...    For this IAM User, provide only one bucket access.
