S3 : Simple Storage Service : 

--> Object based Storage : We can store only flat files.
--> Block based storage : EBS / Instance Store : Designed run OS / Application / cluster.
--> Storage over the Network : NAS/SAN : EFS / FSx : Storage avaiblae over the network..


--> S3 is global resource (like IAM). Doesn't required any region selection.
--> WHile creating bucket, we need to choose the region. Data physically stores in that region.
--> Bucket : FOlder/Directory with unique namespace.
--> Bucket name should be unique across the globe. 
--> Bucket naming standards:
	--> Min char : 3 , Max char: 63 char
	--> No capital letters
	--> Should not start with special char
	--> SHould not start with . , should end with the . , No adjesent ..
	--> Should not resemble IP address format.
--> We have unlimited storage in s3 platform.
--> No Pre-Provisioning required. 
--> Max Object Size is 5 terabytes (TB) , Min Size 0 bytes.

Public Access Settings :
--> To make any object public, We need to "Turn Off" "Block Public ACcess" at bucket level.
--> Choose the object you want to make public, Then "Make Public".

If data is in glacier, we need to initiate restoration.
expedated : 1-5 Min
Standard  : 3-5 Hours
Bulk restore : >12 Hours

___

Versioning : 
--> When versioning is enabled, if we delete an object (Versioning: hide) We will get a delete marker.
--> Delete the DeleteMarket to get the object back to s3.
--> When versining set to "SHOW", if you delete any object it won't create any delete marker.

delete : Create a Delete marker.
permanently delete : It Delete permanently.
