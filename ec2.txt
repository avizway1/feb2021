Price : /Sec (with Min of 60 Sec)

Reserved Instances / RI : Predictable workloads.. Stable workloads.. FOr long terms with AWS.. Duration: 1 Yr / 3 yr

	Standard RI : We cannot change the configuration.

Tenancy : 
Shared Tenancy : underlying hardware shared with multiple customers.
Dedicated Tenancy : Underlying hardware will not share with any other customers.
	--> Dedicated Instane : We wil get dedicated instance.
